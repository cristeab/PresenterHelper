   Presenter Helper aims at replacing the laser pointer used in presentations
by a Creative Interactive Gesture Camera, so that a pointer can be moved on
the screen while the presenter moves his hand in front of the camera.
   Any presentation software can be used as long as slides are changed using
left/right arrow keys. Optionally animations can be activated with the
mouse right click.
   The presenter changes the slides using left/right swipes and a single tap
can be used to either activate presentation animations or can be assigned
as right swipe. If needed, the pointer can be completely hidden.
   The pointer icon (*.jpg and *.png image formats are supported) and 
its size are configurable, also the coordinates of the
upper-left corner of the area covered by the pointer. A scaling factor can
be used in order to make sure that the entire screen area is covered by the
pointer. The number of swipes needed to activate a page switch can be changed,
the default value is one, a value of zero disables the swipe gesture, while
a value superior to one can be used if the slide switch happens too often
during presentation. By default pointer coordinates are filtered with a 
Kalman filter that can be disabled if needed.
   The following shortcut keys are available:
- F1: shows the help
- F2: shows the configuration dialog
- F3: minimizes the pointer
- Ctrl+q: quits the application
